# tsschecker  
tsschecker is a powerful tool to check TSS signing status on combinations of<br/>various devices and iOS/iPadOS/tvOS/watchOS/macOS firmware versions.

## Features  
* Allows you to get lists of all devices as well as all Firmwares and OTA versions for a specific device.
* Can check signing status for any firmware version (by specifying a `BuildManifest.plist`).
* Works without specifying any device relevant values to check signing status, but can be used to save blobs when given an ECID and the option --print-tss-response (although there are better tools to do this).

tsschecker is not only meant to be used to check firmware signing status, but also to explore Apple's TSS servers.
By using all of its customization possibilities, you might discover a combination of devices and firmware versions that is getting signed but wasn't getting signed before. 

# About nonces:
## recommended generators for saving tickets:
* `0xbd34a880be0b53f3` // used on Electra & Chimera jailbreaks
* `0x1111111111111111` // used on unc0ver jailbreak

## Nonce Entangling (Apple A12/S4 and newer)
Newer devices, like the iPhone XR or the Apple Watch Series 4 have nonce-entangling enabled.

this means the boot nonces generated by your device are now also UID derived, and consequently device-specific.<br/>to save usable tickets for a newer device, you need to get the boot nonce that your device actually generates from your generator.

for information on how to get your actual boot nonce, [see this post on r/jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/cssh8f/tutorial_easiest_way_to_save_blobs_on_a12/).

## Nonce Collisions:

the Nonce Collision method only works on a few firmwares and devices, and isn't reliable.<br/>it's better to save a ticket with a generator and use the [checkm8](https://github.com/axi0mx/ipwndfu) bootrom exploit.

Recovery Nonce Collisions only occur on a few iOS versions, like iOS 9.3.3 and iOS 10.1-10.2 on the iPhone 5s<br/>and is not reliable as once you update, your device will either generate different nonce or not collide nonces anymore.

DFU Nonce Collisions commonly occur on any device using A7 and A8 chipsets, regardless of iOS version.<br>and is much more reliable than using recovery collisions.
